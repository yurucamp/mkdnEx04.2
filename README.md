# Flight crew breaks record for circumnavigating globe via both poles
**(CNN)** â€” An international flight crew has broken the record for the fastest 
circumnavigation of the globe via the North and South Poles, with an impressive
margin of almost six hours. 

The 25,000-mile mission, dubbed "One More Orbit" and counting a former 
International Space Station commander among its leaders, was launched in honor 
of the _*Apollo 11*_ moon landings, the 50th anniversary of which is later this month.

The flight, in a [Gulfstream G650ER ultra-long-range jet](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/bombardier-7500-gulfstream-g650-private-jets/index.html), was completed in 46 
hours, 39 minutes and 38 seconds, with an average speed of 860.95 km/hr (534.97 mph).
